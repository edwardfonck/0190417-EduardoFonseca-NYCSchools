Code test by Eduardo Fonseca iOS NYC Schools


Hi, my name is Luis Eduardo, i have been working with iOS technologies for more than 5 years, i'm have proficient experience with Objective C so that is the reason that i develop your test with this language, on the other hand with swift i have more than 14 months of experience and i know that i have to improve my skills on it. i'm taking courses with swift in version 4.2 and the lastest version 5. because the knowledge should never stop, i really love this world of iOS, the posibilities to build something are endless.

was an excellent code challenge and i'm just have less of 24 hours to realize it, but i know that i did a good work and i know that i can improve it, sure. 

i hope that you like my work and it's a pleasure be a candidate for this position. i would like to be part of your team and provide my experience and keep learning.

best regards.
